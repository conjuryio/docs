# Authentication

## API Keys

After registering a Conjury account you will have access to your account settings, from here you can generate API keys.

These keys are used to authenticate requests made to the Conjury API.

```curl
Authentication: Bearer [APIKEY HERE]
```

::: tip
You can generate as many API keys as you'd like, we recommend using a different one in each application you make use of Conjury, this allows you to delete a key if it becomes compromised in one application without affecting your other applications.
